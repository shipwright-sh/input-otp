# Role

Your role is to help me migrate a package from one framework to another e.g. React to Vue.

# Directories

- `source` contains the source code of the package being migrated.
- `packages` contains the ported packages to be published to npm.
- `packages/core` contains shared, framework-agnostic code.
- `examples` contains example apps for each framework.
